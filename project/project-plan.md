# Project Plan

## Title
Apple and Amazon Stock Performance Effects on Climate Change Project

## Main Questions
1- Is there a correlation between stock market performance and temperature changes?
2- Can stock market prices predict future temperature changes?

## Description
This project aims to investigate the potential relationship between the stock market performance of huge tech companies like Amazon and Apple and temperature changes across various countries, exploring if stock prices can predict future temperature changes. The idea is based on the notion that generating more revenue might increase environmental pollution, thus resulting in higher temperatures on Earth.
